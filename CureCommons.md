# 🛡️ CureCommons License (v1.0)

## Preamble

The CureCommons License exists to protect open healing knowledge from being monopolized, hidden, or exploited. It affirms that the right to heal, share, and reproduce scientifically valid protocols is a basic human right.

This license applies to all protocols published within the CureChain registry, including but not limited to: formulations, dosage guidelines, scientific rationale, natural compounds, synthetic variations, and contributor-generated additions.

---

## You May:

✅ Use these protocols freely, for personal, clinical, or research purposes  
✅ Modify, fork, or build upon these protocols  
✅ Reproduce them in full or in part, in any language or jurisdiction  
✅ Translate them into accessible formats (including non-digital)  
✅ Cite them in scientific or community contexts

---

## You May Not:

🚫 Patent or claim exclusive rights to any protocol, data, or derivative  
🚫 Restrict access to downstream versions of these protocols  
🚫 Monetize these protocols as proprietary intellectual property  
🚫 Erase, obscure, or rewrite the historical origin of a CureChain contribution

---

## Attribution

Attribution is not legally required, but ethically encouraged. CureChain recognizes all contributors, cultural origins, and public researchers as co-stewards of human healing knowledge.

If citing, consider:
> "Originally published via CureChain, the decentralized protocol registry for open-source healing."

---

## Final Statement

This license cannot be revoked. Once a protocol enters CureChain, it enters **permanent public memory**.

CureCommons exists to protect that memory — so healing knowledge stays free.

> Healing is a birthright. Science is a bridge. Cures belong to everyone.
