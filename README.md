# 🧬 CureChain

**CureChain** is the world’s first **Decentralized Protocol Registry (DPR)** for open-source, sovereign healing.

This platform enables researchers, practitioners, and sovereign contributors to publish structured, science-aligned healing protocols — while preserving public access, cultural integrity, and blockchain-backed memory.
