# 🌍 CureChain Mission

> **CureChain is a living protocol registry for open-source, decentralized healing.**

We exist to protect and publish healing knowledge that cannot be patented, restricted, or erased.

This is not just a website. CureChain is:

- A **scientific-grade protocol system** for natural and synthetic healing approaches  
- A **global public health utility** accessible to sovereign individuals, practitioners, and researchers  
- A **decentralized knowledge vault**, designed to timestamp and preserve cures on-chain  
- A **blueprint for post-gatekeeping medical innovation**

CureChain brings together:
- 🌱 Ancient wisdom  
- 🧬 Modern science  
- 🔗 Blockchain immutability  
- 💻 Open-source publishing  
- 🧠 AI-assisted acceleration

We do not gatekeep.  
We do not monetize protocols.  
We do not ask for permission.

We publish.  
We protect.  
We remember.

**Welcome to the protocol era.**
